# Description:
The Voting Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline and ensure the integrity of voting processes. Developed with JavaFX, this system offers a user-friendly interface and robust backend, ensuring secure and transparent elections.

The system recognizes two main user types: Voters and Administrators. Each has its own tailored set of functionalities, catering to their specific needs in the voting process.

# Tools Used:

<b>IntelliJ IDEA:</b> Used as the primary development environment, this ensures a consistent and efficient coding practice.</br>
<b>Scene Builder:</b> Assists in designing intuitive user interfaces, enhancing the user experience.</br>
<b>XAMPP Server:</b> Ensures stable database management and web services, allowing for secure data storage and retrieval.</br></br>

# User Types:
<b>Voters:</b> Regular users who have the privilege to cast votes.</br>
<b>Admin:</b> Responsible for managing the voting process, candidates, and voter verification.</br></br>

# Functionalities:</br>

<h3> 1. Voter:</h3>

<b>Dashboard:</b> A clear and concise space where voters can quickly choose their preferred candidate and cast their vote.</br>

<b>Voting Result:</b> Provides transparency, allowing voters to view real-time and final election results.</br>

<b>Profile:</b> A personalized space for each user:</br>
* Displays relevant personal details (e.g., name, voting status, location).</br>
* Ensures security by allowing users to change their login credentials.</br></br>

<h3>2. Admin: </h3> 

<b>Dashboard:</b> A holistic overview of the election at hand. Admins can:</br>
* Track the total number of participants.</br>
* Monitor live updates on election status.</br>
* Have the authority to initiate or conclude the election.</br>
    
<b>Candidate Details:</b> A dedicated space to manage candidate profiles. Admins can:</br>
* Add fresh faces to the election.</br>
* Update candidate details as required.</br>
* Remove candidates if needed.</br>
    
<b>Voting Result:</b> A summarized view of the results, giving admins the data they need to ensure fair elections.</br>

<b>Voters Details:</b> Maintains voter integrity by showing a list of verified voters and relevant details.</br>

<b>Verify Voter:</b> Ensuring the legitimacy of the voting process:</br>
* Every new account undergoes admin scrutiny.</br>
* Accounts stay inactive until verified, ensuring only legitimate votes count.</br>

This system is a step towards more transparent and efficient electoral processes, combining modern technology with the time-honored practice of voting.
